# CNN Model on SVHN Dataset

## Abstract
The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a real-world image dataset used for digit recognition. This project involves building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow to classify images from this dataset. The model's performance is analyzed using accuracy, loss metrics, and visualizations.
